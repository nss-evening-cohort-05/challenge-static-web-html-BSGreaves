				<h4 class="articleHeader">Resources</h4>
				<p>I play a ton of board games. It's a great way to spend quality time with your friends without having to wallow in a smoky bar or blow money on a show.
				Some games I enjoy:

					<h4 class="articleHeader">Future space. In the meantime, King Lear comes to terms with his treacherous children</h4>
					<p>O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars 
					Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
					Allow not nature more than nature needs,
					Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:
					If only to go warm were gorgeous,
					Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st 
					Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-
					You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
					You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
					As full of grief as age; wretched in both.
					If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts 
					Against their father, fool me not so much
					To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
					And let not women's weapons, water drops,
					Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!
					I will have such revenges on you both 
					That all the world shall- I will do such things-
					What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be
					The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.
					No, I'll not weep.
					I have full cause of weeping, but this heart 
					Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
					Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!</p>

					<h4 class="articleHeader">Future space. In the meantime, Coriolanus decries the people of Rome</h4>
					<p>You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
					As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
					As the dead carcasses of unburied men
					That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
					And here remain with your uncertainty!
					Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
					Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
					Fan you into despair! Have the power still
					To banish your defenders; till at length
					Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
					Making not reservation of yourselves,
					Still your own foes, deliver you as most
					Abated captives to some nation
					That won you without blows! Despising,
					For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
					There is a world elsewhere.</p>
